### This is the original FORTRAN code that was reworked into python programs using Flask to deploy as a web page running on a local server.

The fortran code was written many years ago and it works, but it was felt that it was time to update to more modern code.

Python was chosen over JavaScript purely for the abundance of mathematical equations.

There are probably more succinct ways of rendering these equations using more specific python packages but these will be explored at a later date. Right after I get my Masters in Geospatial Data Analysis.
